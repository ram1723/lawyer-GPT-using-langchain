# **Lawyer GPT**

### **Project Overview**
**Lawyer GPT** is a legal chatbot designed for lawyers, built using **Langchain** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**. It allows users to retrieve similar legal cases from a vector database, get relevant news articles via **Bing News API**, and interact with summarization capabilities. The model is tuned to provide efficient legal assistance, perform case-based retrieval, and enable interactive dialogue for legal queries.

### **Installation**

#### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lawyer-gpt.git
cd lawyer-gpt

Environment Setup
Create and activate a virtual environment for the project:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate       # For Windows
Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up API Keys
Bing News API: Get your API key from the Bing News API.
Langchain & OpenAI API: Ensure you have your API keys set for Langchain usage. You can store these in an .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
BING_NEWS_API_KEY=<your_bing_news_api_key>
Usage
Prepare Legal Documents:
Add legal case documents to the documents/ folder for vector storage and retrieval.

Running the Lawyer GPT Chatbot:
Start the chatbot with the following command:

python lawyer_gpt.py
Interacting with the Chatbot:
You can now interact with Lawyer GPT via the terminal. It supports:

Retrieving similar legal cases based on your input query.
Fetching relevant news articles for legal queries using Bing News API.
Summarizing long legal documents for easier consumption.
Handling case PDFs for interactive Q&A.
Vector Database Setup
The vector database is at the core of Lawyer GPT for case retrieval.

Embedding Legal Documents:
You can embed legal cases into a vector database using the following command:

python embed_documents.py --data_path ./documents
The embedded vectors will be stored in a Chroma or FAISS vector store, depending on the configuration.

Querying the Vector Store:
Once documents are embedded, you can query the vector database to retrieve similar legal cases:

python retrieve_cases.py --query "Your legal query here"
Legal Case Retrieval
The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model is used to find similar legal cases based on a query. Here's how it works:

Takes user input (legal query or document).
Searches through the vector database to find and rank similar cases.
Retrieves the most relevant cases and provides summaries or detailed explanations.
Example query:

python lawyer_gpt.py --query "Landmark cases related to contract law in India"
News Integration (Bing News API)
To fetch news articles related to legal cases, Lawyer GPT integrates the Bing News API:

Takes user input related to a legal topic or case.
Fetches recent news articles, reports, or related coverage.
Provides article summaries and direct links.
Example command:

python fetch_news.py --query "Updates on the Supreme Court's decision on corporate law"
Summarization
Lawyer GPT can summarize lengthy legal documents to provide quick insights:

Uses a pre-trained summarization model (e.g., BART, Legal-BERT) to generate abstractive summaries.
Summarizes based on the document or retrieved cases.
Example command:

python summarize.py --file ./documents/landmark_case.pdf
Interactive Chatbot
Lawyer GPT is an interactive chatbot, supporting continuous conversation. It can:

Answer complex legal questions.
Retrieve and discuss similar cases and legal precedents.
Provide detailed case analysis and summaries.
Fetch relevant news in real-time.
To start the interactive chatbot:

python lawyer_gpt.py
It supports conversational context, meaning previous queries are considered during the interaction.

Future Improvements
Expand Dataset: Increase the size and variety of legal cases in the vector database.
Advanced Case Analytics: Integrate tools to identify contradictory or supportive cases for legal counterarguments.
Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune GPT models on specific jurisdictions to improve performance.
Multi-Language Support: Extend capabilities to support multiple languages for global legal use.
Integration with Other APIs: Add APIs for accessing legal precedents, statutes, and regulations beyond news.
